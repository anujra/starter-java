# HTTP-specific options.
http:

  # The port on which the HTTP server listens for service requests.
  # Because Java cannot drop privileges in a POSIX system, these
  # ports cannot be in the range 1-1024. A port value of 0 will
  # make the OS use an arbitrary unused port.
  port: 8060

  # The port on which the HTTP server listens for administrative
  # requests. Subject to the same limitations as "port".
  adminPort: 8061

  # The minimum number of threads to keep running to process
  # incoming HTTP requests.
  minThreads: 8

  # The maximum number of threads to keep running to process
  # incoming HTTP requests.
  maxThreads: 2048

  # The type of connector to use.
  #
  # Possible values are:
  #   * blocking: Good for low-latency services with short request
  #               durations. Corresponds to Jetty's
  #               BlockingChannelConnector.
  #   * nonblocking: Good for services which use Servlet 3.0
  #                  continuations or which maintain a large number
  #                  of open connections. Corresponds to Jetty's
  #                  SelectChannelConnector.
  #   * legacy: Simple, java.io.Socket-based connector. Corresponds to
  #             Jetty's SocketConnector.
  #   * legacy+ssl: Corresponds to Jetty's SslSocketConnector.
  #   * nonblocking+ssl: Corresponds to Jetty's
  #                      SslSelectChannelConnector.
  connectorType: nonblocking

  # The maximum amount of time a connection is allowed to be idle

  # possible priority and with 5 raising them to the highest priority.

  # The number of unaccepted requests to keep in the accept queue
  # before refusing connections. If set to -1 or omitted, the system

  # The number of open connections at which the server transitions
  # to a "low-resources" mode. (Only valid if connectorType is
  # "nonblocking".)
  lowResourcesConnectionThreshold: 25000

  # When in low-resources mode, the maximum amount of time a
  # connection is allowed to be idle before being closed. Overrides
  # maxIdleTime. (Only valid if connectorType is "nonblocking".)
  lowResourcesMaxIdleTime: 5s

  # If non-zero, the server will allow worker threads to finish
  # processing requests after the server socket has been closed for

  # If true, forces the HTTP connector to use off-heap, direct
  # buffers.
  useDirectBuffers: true

  # The hostname of the interface to which the HTTP server socket
  # will be bound. If omitted, the socket will listen on all
  # interfaces.
